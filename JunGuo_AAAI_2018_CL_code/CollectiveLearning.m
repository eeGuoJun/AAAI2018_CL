%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input:
%   X & Y -- Incomplete data, each row is a sample
%   para -- parameters
%      para.k is the number of nearest neighbors for outlier detection.
%      para.c is the number of instances shared by both views.
%      para.a is the number of instances only in view Y.
%      para.b is the number of instance only in view X.
%      para.type: the type of initialization by filling missing data 
%        'mean':     with average features.
%        'linear':   with linear combination of neighbors.
%        'simWeigh': with the similarity-weighted neighbors.
% Output:
%  consistency -- a score vector whose length is n. 
%      (the smaller, the more likely a sample is to be an outlier)
%  Xnew and Ynew -- new X and Y after filling missing data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Note that: 
%     X(1:c,:)       is given
% X = X(c+1:c+a,:)   is missing (all-zero), we need to solve
%     X(c+a+1:end,:) is given (there are b rows)
%     Y(1:c,:)       is given
% Y = Y(c+1:c+a,:)   is given
%     Y(c+a+1:end,:) is missing (all-zero), we need to solve (b rows)
